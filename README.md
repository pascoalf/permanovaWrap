# permanovaWrap
An R function, full_permanova_summary.R, built arround vegan R package. This function calculates a permanova test for up to 2 variables and a user specified model. Besides the permanova, the function will also compute the betadisper test for each variable, which is an equivalent to Leven test of homogeneity of variance. The output is tidy and pipe frindly, which was my main concern and motivation to do this wrapper arround adonis2 and betadisper. This can be usefull if you need to apply the same tests several times for different datasets.  

Currently, this function only works for 2 variables and they need to be specified in the arguments a and b. It shouldn't be to complicated to generalize this function for any number of variables, but I didn't need it so far. If you want to improve this function, that would be a good starting point.
